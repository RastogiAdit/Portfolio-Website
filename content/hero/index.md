I am a 4th-year CS student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, currently pursuing a Data Science minor. My academic journey is complemented by a strong passion for badminton, where I continuously work on improving my skills and competing in local tournaments. Beyond sports, I am an avid traveler, always seeking new cultures, perspectives, and experiences that broaden my worldview. As a lifelong learner, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge across various fields, from technology to personal development. I take pride in applying the skills I acquire to solve real-world problems, fostering both personal and professional growth.

I enjoy learning new skills and implementing them in real life!
