 I built a [POSIX C-based simulator]() for managing up to [100] elevators across [500] floors using pipes, message queues, and shared memory for inter-process communication, enabling precise coordination and high-throughput elevator scheduling under heavy load conditions. I designed scheduling logic to serve over [30 passenger requests per turn](), minimizing total turns while ensuring real-time coordination and movement. Additionally, I integrated authorization protocols via solver processes to dynamically generate and verify strings based on elevator occupancy. Through this project, I demonstrated a robust understanding of inter-process communication, process control, and resource sharing, which are key concepts in [Operating Systems]().
