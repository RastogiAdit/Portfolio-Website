 I built a [POSIX C-based simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library) for managing up to [100](https://github.com/RastogiAdit/Elevator-Manager-Operating-Systems-Project) elevators across [500](https://github.com/RastogiAdit/Elevator-Manager-Operating-Systems-Project) floors using pipes, message queues, and shared memory for inter-process communication, enabling precise coordination and high-throughput elevator scheduling under heavy load conditions. I designed scheduling logic to serve over [30](https://github.com/RastogiAdit/Elevator-Manager-Operating-Systems-Project) passenger requests per turn, minimizing total turns while ensuring real-time coordination and movement. Additionally, I integrated authorization protocols via solver processes to dynamically generate and verify strings based on elevator occupancy. Through this project, I demonstrated a robust understanding of [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication), process control, and resource sharing, which are key concepts in Operating Systems.
