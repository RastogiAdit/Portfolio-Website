 Developed a Diabetes Detection system using [Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) and [Perceptron Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on clinical data. Leveraged supervised learning techniques to train models on a labeled dataset, achieving high classification accuracy. This system aims to assist healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions for early detection and intervention.
