 I developed and deployed a full-stack Twitter clone using the [MERN] stack, implementing core social media features such as post creation, comments, likes, follow/unfollow, authentication, and notifications, ensuring a seamless and highly responsive user experience. I engineered a modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and integrated [TanStack Query (React Query)]() for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization. Additionally, I integrated Cloudinary for scalable image upload and storage, and deployed the application to production, enabling end-to-end functionality with secure backend APIs.
