 Developed an Energy Consumption Forecasting system using [Long Short-Term Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) networks. The project focused on predicting future energy consumption trends based on historical time series data. Achieved high forecasting accuracy by leveraging advanced preprocessing techniques and designing a robust LSTM-based architecture tailored for sequential data analysis. This system can assist in effective energy management and planning.
