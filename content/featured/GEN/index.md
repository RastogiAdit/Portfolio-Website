 I implemented the Exemplar GAN (Ex-GAN) architecture to perform identity-preserving eye in-painting using exemplar methods, as proposed in the Facebook AI research paper. I trained a dual-branch GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks) architecture with a U-Net-based generator and discriminator to ensure face realism and eye-specific detail. To support this, I utilized a curated dataset of celebrity face image pairs (original plus reference eyes), selected to provide high-quality, diverse facial features and varied expressions, enabling robust training and reliable evaluation of generative model performance.
