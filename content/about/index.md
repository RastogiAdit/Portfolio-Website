Hello! I'm Adit Rastogi, from Naya Raipur, which is administrative capital of Chhattisgarh and one of the integrated smart city. My journey in technology began in this peaceful city, shaping my aspirations and outlook.

I pride myself on being creative, punctual, and dedicated, with a strong moral compass. These qualities, combined with my high energy, strong communication skills, and meticulous attention to detail, have been key to my academic and professional achievements. My academic journey led me to the prestigious [Birla Institute of Technology And Science (BITS), Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), where I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering with minor in Data Science and will be graduating in 2026.

During my time at BITS, I have actively pursued my passion for [Badminton](), consistently improving my skills and participating in various games and tournaments. Additionally, I joined the [BITS Comedy Club](), which has been instrumental in enhancing my creativity and contributing to the vibrant college culture. This experience has allowed me to connect with peers, develop teamwork, and engage more deeply in campus life.

To gain hands-on experience, I interned at [Ankle Gaming Pvt. Ltd.]() as my [Practice School-I](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/practice-school/) in BITS, where I developed games using the Unity engine. This experience significantly enhanced my skills as a software engineer while also improving my teamwork and collaboration abilities.

Currently, I am in my 3rd year, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and actively working on my Data Science minor with a focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am dedicated to building a strong foundation in these fields while preparing for future placements and opportunities.

My diverse experiences across academia, college have equipped me with a unique perspective on tackling complex technological challenges. I'm passionate about leveraging my skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning to drive innovation and create meaningful impact in the field of computer science.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
